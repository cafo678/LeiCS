# 5.1 - Still in development

A directional melee combat system, an evolved version of the "Sword" project, since this is always been the combat system I've wanted to build.
This time in 3rd person and with some animation.
This also implements a simil GameplayAbility System.

TODO: Enemy IA to test the directional block mechanic, implement "Runes" (magicks that will be executed with the left hand and can combo with melee attacks) or add mobility.
