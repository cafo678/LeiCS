# 5.3 - Still in development

A directional melee combat system, an evolved version of the "Sword" project, since this is always been the combat system I've wanted to build.
This time in 3rd person and with some animation.
This also implements a simil GameplayAbility System.

Left Stick: Movement  
Right Stick: Directional Actions  

Right Bumper: Attack State  
When in Attack State:  
RightStick: Directional Attack, combo if followed by another directional action at the right time  

Left Bumper: Defense State  
When in Defense State:  
RightStick: Directional Defense, parry if timed correctly  

No Back Keys: Combat State  
When in Combat State:  
RightStick: Directional Dodge, combo if followed by another directional action at the right time  

When parryed and the times slow down, only defense or dodge is allowed while the enemy can attack you.
Viceversa, when a successful parry lands, the enemy will be slowed down and the player can attack.
